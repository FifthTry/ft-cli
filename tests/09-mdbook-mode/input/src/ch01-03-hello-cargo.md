## Hello, Cargo!

Cargo is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool
to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you,
such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and
building those libraries. (We call libraries your code needs *dependencies*.)
