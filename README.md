# `ft-cli`: CLI to Sync FifthTry Content Locally

`ft-cli` is an open source utility to sync content hosted on FifthTry.com with
local folder. It can be used to sync content stored in github to be uploaded to 
FifthTry, or for FifthTry content to be synced with Dropbox etc.

Currently it only supports one way sync: `local-to-remote`, for `ftd` content that 
is stored in `git`. In future we will support `remote-to-local` and `two-way-sync`,
as well as auto conversion back and forth from `mdbook`, `jekyll`, `asciidoc` etc.
